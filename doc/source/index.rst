Spyglass Documentation
======================

Overview
--------
Spyglass is a data extraction tool which can interface with
different input data sources to generate site manifest YAML files.
The data sources will provide all the configuration data needed
for a site deployment. These site manifest YAML files generated
by spyglass will be saved in a Git repository, from where Pegleg
can access and aggregate them. This aggregated file can then be
fed to Shipyard for site deployment / updates.
