# The purpose of this file is to provide Shipyard a strategy to aid in the site's
# deployment. This WILL require modification for each particular site. A successful
# strategy for large labs that has been used in the past has been to split the Control
# Plane hosts up from the computes, as well as the computes by rack. The below strategy
# differs slightly, as the size of the lab is smaller. As such, the Control Plane hosts
# deploy first, followed by half of the computes, followed by the second half of the
# computes. Shipyard deployment strategies can be very useful in getting around certain
# failures, like misbehaving nodes that may hold up the deployment. See more at:
